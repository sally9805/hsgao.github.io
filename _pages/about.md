Hi, my name is Haishan. I am a Software Engineer at Google Shopping developing ML infrastructure and information retrieval algorithms.

I finished my undergraduate study at Northwestern University with a double major in Computer Science and Economics. I was fortunate to work in [the QRG lab](https://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/) under the supervision of Constantine Nakos and Prof. Ken Forbus on natural language understanding and question answering. I also worked with [Prof. Özge Samancı](https://www.ozgesamanci.com/) on interactive art.

My research interest lies at the intersection of NLP, Computational Social Science and Interactive Media. My past research experience was focused on building interactive applications and using computational methods to analyze social issues.

I like reading and writing fictions outside of work.
