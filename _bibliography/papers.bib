  title={Replicated DNS Cache Service backed by Zookeeper-based Membership Management},
  abstract={We design and implement a distributed DNS cache service with replicated cache in a hierarchical structure. Our system demonstrates high availability, horizontal scalability, and robustness to withstand server node failures. It supports instant server membership management to add and remove nodes dynamically. We propose a tailored design of load balancing strategy and consensus protocol in our system that relaxes the consistency requirement to achieve high availability and partition tolerance. The system is deployed and fully tested on Amazon EC2. We measure its latency, throughput and ability to tolerate node failures and validate it outperforms Google DNS service (8.8.8.8) on the latency metric in a local area network environment.},

  title={Sales Prediction Based on Product Titles and Images with Deep Learning Approaches},
  abstract={Over the past few years, online shopping gradually became the mainstream shopping method. More and more local retailers chose to start their businesses on e-commerce platforms. However, few can survive due to the competitive pressure from the big companies and the entry barriers. The motivation of this project is to identify product listing strategies, primarily visual and textual presentation, that can help retailers to raise their product sales. To achieve that, we build a neural network architecture to predict product sales from text, image and other product listing features that retailers can control. In particular, we use pre-trained VGG16 model for image data and TF-IDF model for text data in our architecture. The accuracy of the model is 73.91%, far above the accuracy of human raters, which is 55.33%.},
